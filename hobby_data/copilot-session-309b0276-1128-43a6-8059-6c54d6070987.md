# GitHub Copilot CLI Documentation

## README
# GitHub Copilot CLI (Public Preview)

The power of GitHub Copilot, now in your terminal.

GitHub Copilot CLI brings AI-powered coding assistance directly to your command line, enabling you to build, debug, and understand code through natural language conversations. Powered by the same agentic harness as GitHub's Copilot coding agent, it provides intelligent assistance while staying deeply integrated with your GitHub workflow.

See [our official documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) for more information.

![Image of the splash screen for the Copilot CLI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40aa23d-09dd-499e-9457-1d57d3368887)


## 🚀 Introduction and Overview

We're bringing the power of GitHub Copilot coding agent directly to your terminal. With GitHub Copilot CLI, you can work locally and synchronously with an AI agent that understands your code and GitHub context.

- **Terminal-native development:** Work with Copilot coding agent directly in your command line — no context switching required.
- **GitHub integration out of the box:** Access your repositories, issues, and pull requests using natural language, all authenticated with your existing GitHub account.
- **Agentic capabilities:** Build, edit, debug, and refactor code with an AI collaborator that can plan and execute complex tasks.
- **MCP-powered extensibility:** Take advantage of the fact that the coding agent ships with GitHub's MCP server by default and supports custom MCP servers to extend capabilities.
- **Full control:** Preview every action before execution — nothing happens without your explicit approval.

We're still early in our journey, but with your feedback, we're rapidly iterating to make the GitHub Copilot CLI the best possible companion in your terminal.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Supported Platforms

- **Linux**
- **macOS**
- **Windows**

### Prerequisites

- (On Windows) **PowerShell** v6 or higher
- An **active Copilot subscription**. See [Copilot plans](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans?ref_cta=Copilot+plans+signup&ref_loc=install-copilot-cli&ref_page=docs).

If you have access to GitHub Copilot via your organization or enterprise, you cannot use GitHub Copilot CLI if your organization owner or enterprise administrator has disabled it in the organization or enterprise settings. See [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization](http://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-github-copilot-features-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization) for more information.

### Installation

Install with [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) (Windows):

```bash
winget install GitHub.Copilot
```

```bash
winget install GitHub.Copilot.Prerelease
```

Install with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/copilot-cli) (macOS and Linux):

```bash
brew install copilot-cli
```

```bash
brew install copilot-cli@prerelease
```

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/copilot) (macOS, Linux, and Windows):

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot@prerelease
```

Install with the install script (macOS and Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

Or

```bash
wget -qO- https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

Use `| sudo bash` to run as root and install to `/usr/local/bin`.

Set `PREFIX` to install to `$PREFIX/bin/` directory. Defaults to `/usr/local`
when run as root or `$HOME/.local` when run as a non-root user.

Set `VERSION` to install a specific version. Defaults to the latest version.

For example, to install version `v0.0.369` to a custom directory:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | VERSION="v0.0.369" PREFIX="$HOME/custom" bash
```

### Launching the CLI

```bash
copilot
```

On first launch, you'll be greeted with our adorable animated banner! If you'd like to see this banner again, launch `copilot` with the `--banner` flag.

If you're not currently logged in to GitHub, you'll be prompted to use the `/login` slash command. Enter this command and follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate.

#### Authenticate with a Personal Access Token (PAT)

You can also authenticate using a fine-grained PAT with the "Copilot Requests" permission enabled.

1. Visit https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Under "Permissions," click "add permissions" and select "Copilot Requests"
3. Generate your token
4. Add the token to your environment via the environment variable `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (in order of precedence)

### Using the CLI

Launch `copilot` in a folder that contains code you want to work with.

By default, `copilot` utilizes Claude Sonnet 4.5. Run the `/model` slash command to choose from other available models, including Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5.

### Experimental Mode

Experimental mode enables access to new features that are still in development. You can activate experimental mode by:

- Launching with the `--experimental` flag: `copilot --experimental`
- Using the `/experimental` slash command from within the CLI

Once activated, the setting is persisted in your config, so the `--experimental` flag is no longer needed on subsequent launches.

#### Experimental Features

- **Autopilot mode:** Autopilot is a new mode (press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through modes), which encourages the agent to continue working until a task is completed.

Each time you submit a prompt to GitHub Copilot CLI, your monthly quota of premium requests is reduced by one. For information about premium requests, see [About premium requests](https://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

For more information about how to use the GitHub Copilot CLI, see [our official documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli).

## 🔧 Configuring LSP Servers

GitHub Copilot CLI supports Language Server Protocol (LSP) for enhanced code intelligence. This feature provides intelligent code features like go-to-definition, hover information, and diagnostics.

### Installing Language Servers

Copilot CLI does not bundle LSP servers. You need to install them separately. For example, to set up TypeScript support:

```bash
npm install -g typescript-language-server
```

For other languages, install the corresponding LSP server and configure it following the same pattern shown below.

### Configuring LSP Servers

LSP servers are configured through a dedicated LSP configuration file. You can configure LSP servers at the user level or repository level:

**User-level configuration** (applies to all projects):
Edit `~/.copilot/lsp-config.json`

**Repository-level configuration** (applies to specific project):
Create `.github/lsp.json` in your repository root

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "lspServers": {
    "typescript": {
      "command": "typescript-language-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"],
      "fileExtensions": {
        ".ts": "typescript",
        ".tsx": "typescript"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Viewing LSP Server Status

Check configured LSP servers using the `/lsp` command in an interactive session, or view your configuration files directly.

For more information, see the [changelog](./changelog.md).

## 📢 Feedback and Participation

We're excited to have you join us early in the Copilot CLI journey.

This is an early-stage preview, and we're building quickly. Expect frequent updates--please keep your client up to date for the latest features and fixes!

Your insights are invaluable! Open issue in this repo, join Discussions, and run `/feedback` from the CLI to submit a confidential feedback survey!

### 👤 User

I want to create a local webapp using django and python to view and manage a sqlite database of hobby related records. First I want to create a hobby table having fields ID, CATEGORY, DATE_CREATED, DATE_UPDATED, URL, NOTES. Can you please propose a SQL table definition for the TABLE hobby which will work with sqlite in DJANGO?

---

<sub>⏱️ 8m 23s</sub>

### 💭 Reasoning

***Providing Django model and SQLite table definition**

Here's a Django model with appropriate field types and auto timestamps, along with the corresponding SQLite CREATE TABLE statement using `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` for the id and `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for timestamps.*

---

<sub>⏱️ 8m 24s</sub>

### 💬 Copilot

Here’s a SQLite-compatible table definition that aligns with typical Django fields (auto timestamps, text, URL):

```sql
CREATE TABLE hobby (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  date_created DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  date_updated DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  url TEXT,
  notes TEXT
);
```

In Django you’d usually model this with `auto_now_add` / `auto_now` and let migrations generate the exact SQL.

---

### 👤 User

Let's modify this table definition by adding name TEXT, and description TEXT fields after id. Please show the revised table.

---

CREATE TABLE hobby (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,

  date_updated DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  url TEXT,
  notes TEXT
);
```

<sub>⏱️ 14m 39s</sub>

### 💭 Reasoning

***Drafting Django project plan**

I'm outlining a plan.md for the session-state path that details creating a Django webapp with CRUD using sqlite, assuming project/app names "hobby_site" and "hobbies," and including steps for setup, models, views, urls, templates, and dependencies. Next, I'll create the plan file via an apply_patch.**Using PowerShell with intent report**

I'm choosing to create the plan.md by running a PowerShell command writing the file content, paired with a report_intent call to update intent to "Creating implementation plan," avoiding apply_patch's no-parallel rule. Next, I'll craft the plan content for this command.*

***Scoping dependency setup and baseline checks**

I'm preparing to add Django as a dependency via pyproject and planning to run baseline linters and tests, though the project likely lacks tests and pytest. Next, I'll confirm test presence and decide how to handle baseline checks accordingly.**Planning Django setup and environment checks**

I'm outlining tasks to install Django, start the project, add core components, run migrations, and verify setup, while first confirming the Python version and searching for existing tests or configs to satisfy baseline checks. I'll also create a TODO list reflecting these steps and align with instructions on using available tools and commands.*

### 💭 Reasoning

***Considering Django compatibility with Python 3.14**

Python 3.14.1 is pre-release and likely unsupported by any stable Django version, which may cause install or runtime errors; I'll proceed cautiously with `Django\>=5.1` but expect potential version conflicts during installation.**Planning Django installation and project creation without internet**

I'll add Django to pyproject dependencies and attempt to install it despite likely no internet; if installation fails, I'll create the Django project and app structure manually to follow standard patterns while checking if Django is already installed via a Python import test.*

---

<sub>⏱️ 20m 22s</sub>

### 💭 Reasoning

***Planning manual Django setup with dependency**

I'll add Django as a dependency and create a minimal Django project manually via patches since automatic tools or installs might fail without internet. Running manage.py commands won't work without Django installed, so I'll note that limitation.**Updating dependencies with Django version**

I'm setting Django dependency in pyproject to `Django\>=5.1` for stable support, noting installation might fail due to Python 3.14 compatibility or no internet. I'll update pyproject accordingly using a patch.*

### 💭 Reasoning

***Outlining Django scaffold and model details**

Planning a full scaffold for a Django 5.1 project with a "hobby_site" project and "hobbies" app, including manage.py and standard app/project files. The Hobby model will have required name and category fields, optional description, url, and notes, with automatic timestamps and a string representation. Views will use generic class-based views with fields explicitly listed, skipping custom forms for simplicity.**Finalizing full Django scaffold details**

Detailed all Django scaffold files with standard settings, URLs, apps, models, admin, views, and templates. Included sensible placeholder SECRET_KEY, DEBUG True, app registration, template dirs, and default middleware. Prepared hobbies app with migration init, model with timestamp fields and ordering, admin with search, generic CBV views with explicit fields, URL routing, and complete templates for CRUD views. Ready to generate all files in one patch including nested directories.*

### 💭 Reasoning

***Confirming migration inclusion**

The migration file created by the command is intended to be kept and included in the final repo diff; next, I’ll verify its contents and update the TODO list accordingly.*

### 💭 Reasoning

***Summarizing install and migration outcomes**

The pip install used ensurepip and successfully installed Django 6.0.2, after which migrations created a new migration file and a db.sqlite3 database. Tests were not found or run. Instructions to run the server and note about no tests available will be included.**Confirming summary and test notes**

The Django project includes a Hobby model with full CRUD and admin registration plus a README quickstart; Django was installed and the initial migration created and applied. Tests were not found or run. I'll finalize with a concise two-sentence summary noting migrations ran and tests absence as requested.*

### 💬 Copilot

Summary: added a Django project/app with Hobby CRUD (model, views, URLs, templates, admin) plus README quickstart, and added the Django dependency with the initial migration generated. Tests: not run (no tests found); migrations ran successfully.
